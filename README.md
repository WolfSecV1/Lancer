# 🎨 ProLancer

A modern, OpenGL-powered collaborative canvas — inspired by Krita but built for freelancers, real-time tools, and buttery smooth drawing.

> Built with Qt + QOpenGL, hand-coded geometry, and future-proof vibes.

## 🚀 Features

- ✏️ **Pressure-sensitive strokes** with triangle strip rendering
- ⚙️ Real OpenGL performance (not just a widget hack)
- 🎨 Custom brush pipeline (coming soon)
- 🔄 VBO-backed rendering for stability and speed
